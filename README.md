## Welcome

Web3 security researcher and developer specializing in Rust, Solidity, and WASM for secure blockchain solutions.

## What I Do

- Focused on Web3 Security, with experience in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in smart contracts.
- Developing decentralized applications using Rust and Solidity.
- Leveraging advanced technologies like WASM to create efficient and secure blockchain solutions.

## Pinned Projects

### HoneySnare
A smart contract honeypot designed to attract malicious bot interactions on Ethereum, Polygon, and other Layer 2 networks. Includes a Rust backend that monitors, logs, and archives bot behavior for further analysis. This project serves as a valuable tool for testing vulnerabilities and studying malicious behavior in real time. Currently deployed on Arbitrum.

### WalletAudit
A tool for analyzing wallet health and security, focused on Ethereum and Ethereum Layer 2. Built using Solidity and Rust to provide in-depth wallet analysis and help users assess risk factors.
